# VisionChef: Smart Fridge Assistant

VisionChef is an intelligent web application that helps you reduce food waste and cook creative meals. It uses AI object detection (YOLOv8) to identify ingredients in your fridge from a photo and suggests recipes based on what you have (via Spoonacular API).

The UI is designed with a premium **Samsung One UI** aesthetic, featuring clean lines, large squircles, and intuitive interactions.

## Features

- **AI Ingredient Detection**: Automatically identifies food items in uploaded images using a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model.
- **Smart Recipe Search**: Suggests recipes based on detected ingredients, prioritizing what you already have.
- **Detailed Recipe View**: View full instructions, missing ingredients, and cook times in a beautiful modal.
- **Samsung One UI Design**: Modern, responsive interface with Dark Mode support.
- **Custom Training**: Includes scripts to merge datasets and fine-tune the model on specific ingredients.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.8+** (for the backend)
2.  **Node.js 16+** & **npm** (for the frontend)
3.  **Git**

## API Keys

You will need API keys for the following services:

1.  **Spoonacular API**: For fetching recipes. [Get Key](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
2.  **Roboflow API**: For downloading training datasets (only needed if training/evaluating). [Get Key](https://roboflow.com/)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Start-Catch-Up/VisionChef.git
cd VisionChef
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and set up the Python environment.

```bash
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Configuration:**
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (or rename `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your keys:

```env
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_spoonacular_key_here
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_roboflow_key_here
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

### Start Backend

In the `backend` directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

_The backend will start at `http://localhost:8000`_

### Start Frontend

In the `frontend` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

_The frontend will start at `http://localhost:5173`_

## Model Training (Optional)

If you want to fine-tune the object detection model:

```bash
cd backend
python train.py
```

This script will:

1.  Download "Food in Fridge" and "Food Ingredients" datasets from Roboflow.
2.  Merge them into a unified dataset.
3.  Train a YOLOv8 model (results saved to `runs/detect/train/`).
